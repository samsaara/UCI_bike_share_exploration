## Exploring UCI's bike sharing dataset

This is a sample data exploration of this bike sharing [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) that I have done a while ago.

### Setup
1. `PIP` install `Pandas, Seaborn, Bokeh` packages (in a `virtualenv`)
2. Download the dataset and extract in your fav. directory
3. Place the `bike_sharing_exploration.ipynb` notebook in that same directory.
4. Play with the code :)
